### Hi there 👋
I'm Daniel Raymond. I do a wide range of things, including sensor development, full-stack, and data science. Previously I've worked at SpaceX, AMD, Untether AI, and Applied Brain Research.

### Repos Overview
#### Embedded & Firmare Projects
- [Segway Simulation (Inverse Pendulum)](https://github.com/draymond63/segway)
  - Developing a simulation a segway to determine physical requirements for components
  - In the future I plan to purchase components based on the requirements and 
    build a physical (miniature) segway that can drive around!
- [Custom Q Extraction](https://github.com/draymond63/resonator-Q-extraction)
  - There are many ways to extract the quality factor (Q) from a frequency sweep
  - This is me playing around with a new method (instead of fitting a Bode or Nyquist plot 👀)
**Older Projects**
- [FPGA Neural Network](https://github.com/draymond63/Andro)
- [Automatic Plant Watering System](https://github.com/draymond63/smartPot)
- [Velocity Data Logger](https://github.com/draymond63/I2C-Velocity-Data-Logger)
- [Shift Register Bar Graph](https://github.com/draymond63/Shift-Register-Bar-Graph)
- [Four-Wire Fan](https://github.com/draymond63/Fan)
- [Asm Snake on LED Matrix](https://github.com/draymond63/Snake)

#### Data Science Projects
- [Defining Prerequisite Trees](https://github.com/draymond63/Prerequisite-Tree)
  - The internet has so much knowledge, but it's hard to know where to start
  - I am attempting to use Wikipedia articles to tell a user what to learn before
    they can understand any topic.
  - As not all knowledge is heirarchical, I am currently just doing this for math articles
- [Passion Mapping](https://github.com/draymond63/passion)
  - Some knowledge is relational, so it'd be great to visualize the "proximity" of topics
  - I used Wiki articles (w/ click-through rates & word2vec) to map all articles into a 2D
    space. Clustering this space allows you to understand true groupings of topics

#### Full Stack Projects
- [UW Blueprint: Rowan House Course Platform](https://github.com/uwblueprint/rowan-house)
  - I am a Project Lead at my University's student [design team](https://uwblueprint.org/)
  - We are developing a course platform for an [Albert-based NPO](https://www.rowanhouse.ca/) to save them $10 000
- [Personal Website](https://github.com/draymond63/website)
  - Currently made in Nuxt (Next + Vue) with some sweet sweet continuous integration 😎
- [Passion Finding App](https://github.com/draymond63/passion-app)
  - Built an [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RaymondDevs.PassionFruit) where users can search a 2D space of topics they might be interested in
  - Uses the map made in the corresponding data science project
- [Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference](https://github.com/cutc-official/cutc-official.github.io)
  - Project Lead for [CUTC](https://cutc.ca/)

### Current Focuses
I'm currently working on [segway](https://github.com/draymond63/segway) and [Prerequisite Tree](https://github.com/draymond63/Prerequisite-Tree).
